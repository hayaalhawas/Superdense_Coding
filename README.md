# Quantum Tasks: Superdence Coding 


## Task 1: Building the Superdence Coding Protocol
In this task, you will work with qubits using Qiskit to create a function that applies Superdense coding. which will Transmit two
classical bits using one Qubit


## Steps:
1. Set up your Python environment with Qiskit and import the required libraries.
2. The process starts with a third party that will prepare two qubits in an entangled state.
3. The third party sends the first qubit to Sara and the second qubit to Khalid.
4. Khalid receives Sara's qubit (leftmost qubit) and uses his qubit to decode Sara's message
5. Finally, we can put this together to complete our protocol.
